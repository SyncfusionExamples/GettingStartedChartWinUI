# GettingStartedChartWinUI

This repository contains the samples that demonstrate the functionalities of WinUI chart controls.

Instead of SfChart, we have provided the following chart types in WinUI.

* Cartesian chart
* Circular chart
* Pyramid chart
* Funnel chart
* Polar chart

#### Cartesian chart

A Cartesian chart is an elegant way to visualize data. Charts supports more than 15 Cartesian chart types such as line, spline, column, bar, area, scatter, and bubble.

#### Circular chart

A circular chart is user-friendly and gives greater UI visualization of data with proportions and percentages of different categories.

The pyramid chart is used to represent hierarchies visually in a pyramid-like structure that shows proportions of a total.

The polar chart is used to visualize data in terms of values and angles. It provides options for visual comparison among several quantitative or qualitative aspects of a situation.
